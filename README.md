# Docker build Tasks

A VSTS build task that helps you build and release Docker containers.

This is a community project, free and open source. Everyone is invited to contribute, fork, share and use the code. No money shall be charged by this
software, nor it will be. Ever.

## Installing

You should go to the Visual Studio Marketplace and install from there.
[Here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lambda3.lambda3docker)
you will find this extension.

You can also checkout the [overview](https://github.com/Lambda3/vsts-build-task-docker/blob/master/overview.md)
page which contains the info displayed on the Marketplace.

## Contributing

Questions, comments, bug reports, and pull requests are all welcome.
Bug reports that include steps-to-reproduce (including code) are
preferred. Even better, make them in the form of pull requests.
Before you start to work on an existing issue, check if it is not assigned
to anyone yet, and if it is, talk to that person.

## Issues

* Check out the [Github backlog](https://github.com/Lambda3/vsts-build-task-docker/issues) directly.

### Pull request

When you are done, pull the changes from the `master` branch.

If you know git well, you can rebase your changes instead of merging them. If not, it is ok to merge them.
When your changes are up to date with the
`master` branch then you should push them to your Github repo and then you will be able to issue
a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) and
mention the issue you were working on. Make your PR message clear. If when you are creating the pull request on
Github it mentions that the PR cannot be merged because there are conflicts it means you forgot to integrate
the `master` branch. Correct that push the changes to your personal repo. This will automatically update the PR.
The project maintainers should not have to resolve merge conflicts, you should.

### Rules for contribution

* Must mention an existing issue on Github
* Don't reformat any code but the one you produced
* Follow the coding standards already in place within the project

If you work on something that you have not yet discussed with the maintainers
there is a chance the code might be denied.
They are easily reachable through Twitter or on Github. Before you code discuss it with it them.
